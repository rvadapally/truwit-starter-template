	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
	<p>
		Truwit is the lightweight verification layer for digital media—attaching cryptographic provenance,
		consent, and authenticity to AI-generated or user-created content. In an era where AI-generated content
		is becoming increasingly sophisticated and indistinguishable from human-created content, Truwit provides
		the essential infrastructure for trust and transparency.
	</p>

	<h2>What We Do</h2>
	<p>
		We specialize in creating cryptographic proofs that verify the origin, consent, and authenticity of
		digital content. Our technology ensures that every piece of media—whether created by humans or AI—can
		be traced back to its source with mathematical certainty.
	</p>

	<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
	<p>
		As AI technology advances, the line between human and machine-generated content continues to blur.
		This creates new challenges for content creators, consumers, and platforms alike. Truwit addresses
		these challenges by providing a universal standard for content verification that works across all
		platforms and media types.
	</p>

	<h2>Our Vision</h2>
	<p>
		We envision a future where every piece of digital content carries with it a cryptographic signature
		that proves its provenance and authenticity. This will enable new forms of creative expression,
		protect intellectual property, and build trust in our increasingly digital world.
	</p>
